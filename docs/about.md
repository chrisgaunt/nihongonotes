# About Nihongo Notes

## June 2022

I previously obtained a basic (but kind of broken) spoken level of Japanese whilst living in Japan, but after returning to the UK and no longer speaking it I've only retained an ability to understand very basic spoken Japanese and struggle to speak it. My reading level is limited to the kana with some kanji keywords retained from starting and dropping RTK (many times) in the past.

I now have a keen interest in continuing my language journey in both speaking and reading Japanese.

When I previously studied the language I would often burn out on Anki decks, getting overwhelmed with reviews, and give up for weeks at a time. This time I intend to get straight into interesting content via immersion learning, and power through the language basics to fill in any gaps. I'll use Anki sparingly and keep it manageable.

Another issue I had in the past was the lack of feedback and knowing how far I'd come. To fix some of this I'm keeping notes here. The idea being that I can search my immersion notes to make further connections between words or phrases, and seeing the site grow will help me see how far I've come. To also keep myself accountable and on track I'll be updating the activity log with whatever I did in Japanese that day.

I'm sharing these notes publicly as they may help others taking the same journey.
