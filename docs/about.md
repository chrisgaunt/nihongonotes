# About Nihongo Notes

My kids and I found the flashcards we remember the best are physical cards with pictures on.

They are both huge Pokémon fans and, in an effort to make learning Japanese more fun for them, I came up with the idea of creating a sort of flashcard similar to Pokémon cards.

These aren't traditional flashcards with a front and a back, there is only a front, but we hide the bottom half of the card when testing each other.

After using rough versions for fun, I've found the act of creating the cards and researching the contents to be a big help in my own studies of Japanese.

So I decided to make newer versions and collect them on this site whilst I refresh on the basics and continue my study for the JLPT.

Some of these cards are personal, using particular games, shows and anime characters we like. However, if you wish to use them in your own study please feel free!
