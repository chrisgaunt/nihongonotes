# About

## What is Nihongo Notes?

Nihongo Notes is a collection of custom study cards and notes related to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) and Japanese language immersion.

## Are these Pokémon cards?

No, these are Japanese study cards inspired by Pokémon cards.

## Why?

The very first version of these were vocabulary cards made for my kids. They are massive Pokémon fans and I was looking for a way to make learning Japanese vocabulary more fun for them.

I then made a few grammar and kanji cards for myself and found it to be a fun and rewarding way of tracking my progress through the language.

And so I put together this site as a collection of cards showing my progress and immersion in the Japanese language.

## Can I use these cards for my own study?

Feel free! I've put them online so I can keep track of my own progress. If someone else finds these useful or gets inspired to also make something fun, then that's a bonus!

But please remember these are made for my own personal use, so particle names and kanji keywords will be personal to me.
