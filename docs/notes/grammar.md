## Grammar

<hr>

### Every sentence includes が

が is always there but might be invisible in a sentence.

``` mermaid

    A("私が")---B("ケーキを")---C("食べる")
    D("Øが")-.-E("ケーキを")---F("食べる")
    style D fill:#fff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,color:#000,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

With the context of "私" already established the Øが sentence above also means "I eat cake".

``` mermaid
graph LR
    A["私は"]---B("Øが")-.-C("アメリカ人だ")
    D["As for me,"]---E("I")-.-F("am American")
    style B fill:#fff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,color:#000,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style E fill:#fff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,color:#000,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```
私はアメリカ人だ means "I am American".  
The literal translation is "As for me, I am American".  
The hidden Øが is the "I".

``` mermaid
graph LR
    A["私は"]---B("Øが")-.-C("うなぎだ")
    D["As for me,"]---E("it")-.-F("is eel")
    style B fill:#fff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,color:#000,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style E fill:#fff,stroke:#666,stroke-width:2px,color:#000,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

私はうなぎだ in the context of ordering a meal, does not mean "As for me, I am an eel", it means "As for me, **it** is eel".  
Øが is "it" and not "I" in this case, and **it** is "what we are eating/ordering".
