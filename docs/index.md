# Welcome to Nihongo Notes

## 日本語ノートへようこそ

Nihongo Notes is a collection of my personal notes from learning Japanese.  

### [Path](/path/)

The path I'm taking on my language learning journey and my progress so far.

### [Notes](/notes/grammar/)

All my notes including summaries of grammar resources and various immersion media.

### [Resources](/resources/)

The full list of resources I'm using or plan to use as part of my studies and immersion.

### [Kanji](/kanji/grade1/)

A list of kanji in the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course order, grouped by Japanese school grade. I'm reviewing each kanji as I come across it during immersion and updating keywords and contexts. I find this very useful combined with the site search for reviewing kanji during immersion.
