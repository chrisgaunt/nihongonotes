This page lists out the immersion and study material I'm working through, split into different content sections, and in each section is the order in which I plan to tackle each item (mainly from easiest to most difficult). The ordering is very subjective, and some items I've considered easier purely because I have more interest in them or because they are a stepping stone to something else I'm interested in.
