# Time to focus

After spending a day putting this site together I'm finally putting my distracting side projects, games and TV shows on pause to really focus on learning Japanese.

<!-- more -->

I'd gotten to a patchy N4 in the past, but after many burnouts and breaks spanning 6-8+ months at a time over many years, I'm placing myself firmly back at N5 and gradually working my way back up.

Progress Today:

* 16 Cards
* 11 Foo
