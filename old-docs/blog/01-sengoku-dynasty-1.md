# Sengoku Dynasty

<img src="../../../../images/blog/sengoku-dynasty.jpg" alt="Sengoku Dynasty">

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1702010/Sengoku_Dynasty/" target="_blank">Sengoku Dynasty</a> is an early access game by developer Superkami and published by Toplitz.

Due to the fact it's very early access right now with limited content and will be updated regularly, I except I'll be restarting my games often.
This means the game diary will also get restarted, but I think this is actually beneficial because I get to review my previous diaries and take a second try at writing about the same scenarios.
