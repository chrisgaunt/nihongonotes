# Game Diaries

In an effort to try some Japanese output I'm going to start doing a bit of creative writing :thought_balloon:
These diary entries will be written from the point of view of my in-game character.

I'll start off simple, and it may get repetitive, but I aim to keep doing it and gradually improve and expand the writing as my Japanese grammar and vocabulary increases.

It'll be fun! :sparkles:
