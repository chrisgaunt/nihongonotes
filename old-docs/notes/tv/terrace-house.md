### Boys x Girls Next Door (2012-2014)

This is only available in Japanese on the Japan Netflix, so I'm going to save this until last. My thought is that by the time I complete the other series I can sit back, relax and enjoy this one.

After that I might watch the other series again but with the commentary audio, which adds a whole new (mostly humurous) angle to it.
